            A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual selectors in 
            the list. (A comma is U+002C). For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same declarations, they maybe grouped into
            a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the comma.

            CSS example: <br>
            In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus,<br>
            h1 font family: sans-serif<br>
            h2 font family: sans-serif<br>
            h3 font family: sans-serif<br>
            is equivalent to: <br>
            h1, h2, h3 {font family: sans-serif}
        </p>
